                            centuries, it was common in English-language texts to capitalise the
                            first letter of common “important” nouns, probably as a result of the
                            influence of continental, particularly German, books. However, this was
                            not done systematically; one reason may be that each printer had their

                                Bellamy not to display art depicting the Parable of the Prodigal Son,
                                one of the parables of Jesus Christ in the Bible, appearing in Luke
                                15:11-32. The parable is framed as a response to a criticism of Jesus by
                                the Pharisees and scribes for receiving sinners and eating with them,
                                and emphasises God’s mercy towards the repentant. Hornet seems to warn
                                that, if Bellamy shows this parable to her young male guests, they may
                                restrict how much they spend on their dowries.</note>, 'twill fright</l>

                            could be an allusion to a biblical story, since in Act I, Scene II,
                            Hornet advises Bellamy to hang a picture depicting another biblical
                            story, that of the Prodigal Son. Although there are many
                            references to harlots in the Bible, in this case they could be talking
                            about Rahab, “the harlot of Jericho”. Rahab helped the Israelites
                            capture Jericho, and she and her family were then incorporated as Jewish
                            people. Hornet, a Jew, would see in her a good example of his faith.
                            Indeed, as Hornet explains to Bellamy in Act I, he believes that
                            paintings should be displayed to convey certain messages. In this case,
                            Rahab would be an example of faith, virtuosity and righteous behaviour
                            to his niece (to whom, on more than one occasion, he refers in similar
                            terms to “harlot”). However, given that this play is full of
                            classical references, they could also be talking about Helen of Troy,
                            usually portrayed as the one responsible for the Trojan War by
                            abandoning Menelaus for Paris. This interpretation would also make
                            sense, since in the masque in Act IV, Scene III, Playfaire will play
                            Paris and the Neece will play Helen.</note>:</l>

                            Whittington (c. 1354–1423), a wealthy merchant and later Lord Mayor of
                            London. The legend says he made a fortune through the sale of his cat to
                            a rat-infested country. The Niece makes reference to this same story in
                            the following lines. Also known as “An Old Ballad of Whittington and his
                            cat” or “Londons Glory, and Whittingtons Renown”, the ballad was very
                            popular during the 17th and 18th centuries. The earliest surviving piece
                            that makes reference to this story dates from 1612. </note> who, they

                            famous at the time. Warbeck was the titular character in a Caroline-era
                            play by John Ford, which adds another layer of theatricality to this
                            reference. In the 1661 quarto version of The Constant Maid, references
                            to Warbeck are replaced by references to Lambert Simnel, a more recent
                            pretender to the throne (Reimer pp. 146). </note>,</l>

                            Philip IV (1605-1665), King of Spain from 1621 to 1665, chose Count-Duke
                            of Olivares (1587-1645) as his royal favourite. After the Twelve Years’
                            Truce (1609-1621), Olivares’ foreign policy focused on trying to win the
                            Eighty Years’ War, which ended in 1648 with the recognition of the
                            independence of the seven United Provinces (part of the Low Countries),
                            now known as the Netherlands. What Clement implies by this comment is
                            that if Philip IV had not had the Count-Duke of Olivares, his political
                            brain and arm, England would have tried to take over the
                            Netherlands.</note></hi></l>

                     one of the most famous in classical mythology. The trial takes place during the
                     wedding of Thetis and Peleus, which was attended by all the deities except
                     Eris, the personification of discord, who had not been invited. In revenge,
                     this goddess threw a golden apple with the inscription “to the fairest one”,
                     which led to the subsequent quarrel of three goddesses at the Judgement of
                     Paris and ultimately caused the Trojan War. Here, Hornet refers to that golden
                     apple and to the three goddesses: Juno (Hera), Pallas (Athena) and Venus
                     (Aphrodite). In 1646 Shirley would write a whole masque inspired by this myth:
                     The Triumph of Beauty.</note></stage>

                     Troy. Paris was abandoned at birth by his parents because Hecuba had a dream
                     during her pregnancy: she dreamt that she would give birth to a flaming torch
                     that would destroy the city, so Priam ordered his servant Agelaus to abandon
                     the child on Mount Ida. Agelaus, at the last moment, took pity on the newborn
