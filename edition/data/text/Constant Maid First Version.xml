                            could be an allusion to a biblical story, since in Act I, Scene II,
                            Hornet advises Bellamy to hang a picture depicting another biblical
                            story, that of the Prodigal Son. <lb/> Although there are many
                            references to harlots in the Bible, in this case they could be talking
                            about Rahab, “the harlot of Jericho”. Rahab helped the Israelites
                            capture Jericho, and she and her family were then incorporated as Jewish
                            people. Hornet, a Jew, would see in her a good example of his faith.
                            Indeed, as Hornet explains to Bellamy in Act I, he believes that
                            paintings should be displayed to convey certain messages. In this case,
                            Rahab would be an example of faith, virtuosity and righteous behaviour
                            to his niece (to whom, on more than one occasion, he refers in similar
                            terms to “harlot”). <lb/> However, given that this play is full of
                            classical references, they could also be talking about Helen of Troy,
                            usually portrayed as the one responsible for the Trojan War by
                            abandoning Menelaus for Paris. This interpretation would also make
                            sense, since in the masque in Act IV, Scene III, Playfaire will play
                            Paris and the Neece will play Helen.</note>:</l>

                            type="intertextual">The Neece refers to a ballad about Richard
                            Whittington (c. 1354–1423), a wealthy merchant and later Lord Mayor of
                            London. The legend says he made a fortune through the sale of his cat to
                            a rat-infested country. The Niece makes reference to this same story in
                            the following lines. Also known as “An Old Ballad of Whittington and his
                            cat” or “Londons Glory, and Whittingtons Renown”, the ballad was very
                            popular during the 17th and 18th centuries. The earliest surviving piece
                            that makes reference to this story dates from 1612. </note> who, they
