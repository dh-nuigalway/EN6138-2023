                            centuries, it was common in English-language texts to capitalise the
                            first letter of common “important” nouns, probably as a result of the
                            influence of continental, particularly German, books. However, this was
                            not done systematically; one reason may be that each printer had their
                            own personal preferences. </note>.</l>

                            Bellamy not to display art depicting the Parable of the Prodigal Son,
                            one of the parables of Jesus Christ in the Bible, appearing in Luke
                            15:11-32. The parable is framed as a response to a criticism of Jesus by
                            the Pharisees and scribes for receiving sinners and eating with them,
                            and emphasises God’s mercy towards the repentant. Hornet seems to warn
                            that, if Bellamy shows this parable to her young male guests, they may
                            restrict how much they spend on their dowries.</note>, 'twill fright</l>
