                                >The editor of the 1833 text included “Put off the knowledge that
                                you are [my] mother.” It is important to note how this changes the
                                meaning of this piece of dialogue. Frances telling Bellamy to
                                disregard the fact that she is generally a mother as opposed to her
                                own mother is a significant distinction. She is emphasizing that
                                Bellamy should have been more empathetic towards her for this
                                reason, and not have withheld the truth from her.</note></l>

                                OED, “galley-foist” is “a state barge, esp. that of the Lord Mayor
                                of London” (OED n. 1). Hornet is probably doing a reference to the
                                Lord Mayor’s Show, in which the lord mayor leads a procession to
                                Westminster, originally on a barge. The fact that the vast majority
                                of the quotations in the OED date from the 17th century leads us to
                                assume that this celebration was very popular in this time

                                most famous in classical mythology. The trial takes place during the
                                wedding of Thetis and Peleus, which was attended by all the deities
                                except Eris, the personification of discord, who had not been
                                invited. In revenge, this goddess threw a golden apple with the
                                inscription “to the fairest one”, which led to the subsequent
                                quarrel of three goddesses at the Judgement of Paris and ultimately
                                caused the Trojan War. Here, Hornet refers to that golden apple and
                                to the three goddesses: Juno (Hera), Pallas (Athena) and Venus
                                (Aphrodite). In 1646 Shirley would write a whole masque inspired by

                                instructs Hermes to choose another person to act as judge in the
                                contest. The chosen one is Paris, second son of Priam, King of Troy.
                                Paris was abandoned at birth by his parents because Hecuba had a
                                dream during her pregnancy: she dreamt that she would give birth to
                                a flaming torch that would destroy the city, so Priam ordered his
                                servant Agelaus to abandon the child on Mount Ida. Agelaus, at the
                                last moment, took pity on the newborn and decided to raise him as
                                his own son.</note>; So.</l>
